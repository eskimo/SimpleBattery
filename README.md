# Simple-Battery

Seems to work? I'm new to Apple Watch dev and made this in a few minutes. 

Basically when I got my Watch Series 4 I was disgusted at the circular battery on the Utility face and thought it should be more like how everything else gets displayed.

Feel free to improve if I did something horribly wrong.
